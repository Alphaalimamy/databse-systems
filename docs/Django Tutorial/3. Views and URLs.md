**Views**

Views are Python functions that take a web request and return a web response.


Define views in **events/views.py**
```python
from django.shortcuts import render
from django.http import HttpResponse

def home(request):
    return HttpResponse("Welcome to Event Registration!")
```

```python
from django.shortcuts import render
from django.http import HttpResponse

def events(request):
    return HttpResponse("Welcome to Event Details")
```

**URLS**

URLs define the routing of your application. They map URLs to views.

To create URLs in Django:

- Create a python file call url.py in the event app
- Define URLs in **events/urls.py**

```python
from django.urls import path
from . import views
urlpatterns = [
    path('', views.home, name='home'),
    path('details', views.details, name='details'),
]
```

**Include App URLs into Project URLs**

- Create an app within your project: python manage.py startapp events
- In the urls.py of your project and app, define URL patterns using path()
- In **event_registration/urls.py**, include app URLs


```python
from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import path, include

urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
    path('', include('events.urls')),
]
```
