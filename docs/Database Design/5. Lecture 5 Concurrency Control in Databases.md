## Concurrency Control in Databases

**Learning Outcomes:**
By the end of this lecture, students will be able to:
- Understand the importance of concurrency control in multi-user database systems.
- Explain the challenges that arise when multiple transactions access and modify data concurrently.
- Describe various concurrency control mechanisms and their implications.
- Implement concurrency control techniques using MySQL.
- Create and manipulate a sample MySQL database to demonstrate concurrency control concepts.

**Introduction:**
- Concurrency Control: Ensuring correct and consistent behavior of a database in the presence of multiple concurrent transactions.
- Multi-User Systems: Databases are often accessed simultaneously by multiple users or applications.
- Significance of Concurrency Control: Prevents data anomalies, maintains data integrity, and ensures proper transaction execution.

**Objectives of Concurrency Control:**
- Isolation: Ensuring transactions execute as if they were executed one after another, maintaining data integrity.
- Serializability: Ensuring that concurrent executions produce the same result as if they were executed serially.
- Consistency: Maintaining the correctness and integrity of the database.
- Deadlock Prevention/Resolution: Avoiding or resolving situations where transactions are stuck waiting for each other.
- High Throughput: Enabling a high number of transactions to be executed concurrently.

**Concurrency Control Mechanisms:**

**A. Lock-Based Protocols:**
- Two-Phase Locking (2PL): Transactions request locks before accessing data and release them afterward.
- Deadlocks: Situations where transactions wait indefinitely for each other's locks.
- Deadlock Handling: Timeout-based or resource allocation graph approaches.

**B. Timestamp Ordering:**
- Assigning timestamps to transactions to order their execution.
- Ensures serializability by using transaction timestamps to order conflicting operations.

**C. Multiversion Concurrency Control (MVCC):**
- Maintaining multiple versions of data to enable concurrent reading and writing.
- Each transaction reads a consistent snapshot of the database.

**Implementing Concurrency Control in MySQL:**

MySQL provides mechanisms to implement concurrency control:
**Lock-Based Mechanisms:**

- InnoDB storage engine supports row-level locking using shared and exclusive locks.
- Locks are acquired implicitly through SQL statements like `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE`.

**MVCC in InnoDB:**
- InnoDB uses MVCC to ensure read consistency and non-blocking reads.
- `READ COMMITTED and REPEATABLE READ` isolation levels determine how snapshots are used.

**Step 1: Create the Database and Tables**
    
```sql
-- Create the database
CREATE DATABASE CustomerDB;

-- Use the database
USE CustomerDB;

-- Create the Customers table
CREATE TABLE Customers (
    CustomerID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    Name VARCHAR(100),
    Balance DECIMAL(10, 2)
);

-- Create the Orders table
CREATE TABLE Orders (
    OrderID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    CustomerID INT,
    TotalAmount DECIMAL(10, 2),
    FOREIGN KEY (CustomerID) REFERENCES Customers(CustomerID)
);
```

**Example 1: Simple Concurrent Updates**
```sql
-- User 1: Update customer balance
BEGIN;
UPDATE Customers SET Balance = Balance - 50 WHERE CustomerID = 123;
COMMIT;

-- User 2: Update customer balance
BEGIN;
UPDATE Customers SET Balance = Balance + 30 WHERE CustomerID = 123;
COMMIT;
```
In this scenario, both users simultaneously update the same customer's balance. The database system ensures that the changes are applied one after another to maintain consistency.

**Example 2: Deadlock Handling**

```sql
-- User 1: Transfer funds
BEGIN;
UPDATE Customers SET Balance = Balance - 100 WHERE CustomerID = 123;
UPDATE Customers SET Balance = Balance + 100 WHERE CustomerID = 124;
COMMIT;

-- User 2: Transfer funds (conflict!)
BEGIN;
UPDATE Customers SET Balance = Balance - 50 WHERE CustomerID = 124;
UPDATE Customers SET Balance = Balance + 50 WHERE CustomerID = 123;
COMMIT;
```
Here, both users attempt to transfer funds involving the same accounts but in different order. A deadlock could occur, and the database system detects and resolves it by rolling back one of the transactions.

**Example 3: Serializable Isolation Level**
```sql
-- Set isolation level to SERIALIZABLE
SET SESSION TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL SERIALIZABLE;

-- User 1: Check customer balance
BEGIN;
SELECT Balance FROM Customers WHERE CustomerID = 123;
COMMIT;

-- User 2: Update customer balance (conflict!)
BEGIN;
UPDATE Customers SET Balance = Balance + 20 WHERE CustomerID = 123;
COMMIT;
```

With the SERIALIZABLE isolation level, User 2's update operation is blocked until User 1's read operation completes. This prevents conflicts and ensures a consistent view of data.

**Example 4: Read-Write Conflict**
```sql
-- User 1: Check customer balance
BEGIN;
SELECT Balance FROM Customers WHERE CustomerID = 123;
COMMIT;

-- User 2: Update customer balance (conflict!)
BEGIN;
UPDATE Customers SET Balance = Balance - 10 WHERE CustomerID = 123;
COMMIT;
```
In this case, User 2's update operation conflicts with User 1's read operation. The database system detects this and ensures that the update is not performed until User 1's transaction is complete.

**Example 5: Optimistic Concurrency Control**
```sql
-- User 1: Read customer balance
BEGIN;
SELECT Balance FROM Customers WHERE CustomerID = 123;

-- User 2: Update customer balance (assuming no conflict)
BEGIN;
UPDATE Customers SET Balance = Balance + 5 WHERE CustomerID = 123;
COMMIT;

-- User 1: Update customer balance (conflict detected!)
-- Rollback and retry after resolving conflict
ROLLBACK;
```

In this case, User 1 reads the customer balance and detects a conflict when attempting to update it. Optimistic concurrency control allows User 1 to handle the conflict by rolling back and reattempting the operation.


**Summary**

Concurrency control ensures that multiple transactions can interact smoothly in a multi-user environment, preventing data inconsistencies and conflicts.
