 Database Design and Implementation Lab Exercise

**Objective**

The objective of this lab exercise is to provide students with hands-on experience in designing and implementing a relational database system for a sample business problem. Students will be required to identify entities, attributes, keys, and relationships and then implement the database using MySQL. Finally, they will display the solution through SQL queries.

**Business Problem Scenario**

Imagine a small online bookstore called "BookWorld." BookWorld wants to create a database to manage its inventory and customer information. The bookstore sells books, eBooks, and audiobooks. Each book has a title, author(s), ISBN, and price. Customers can create accounts, place orders, and leave reviews.

**Tasks**

**Entity Identification**
- Identify the entities in the problem scenario.

**Attribute Identification**
- For each entity, list the attributes associated with it.

**Key Identification**

Determine the primary keys for each entity.
Relationship Identification:

Identify and describe the relationships between the entities (one-to-one, one-to-many, or many-to-many).
Database Schema Design:

Based on your analysis, design a relational database schema using appropriate tables for each entity. Ensure that primary and foreign keys are defined correctly to maintain referential integrity.
MySQL Implementation:

Implement the database schema in MySQL. Write SQL commands to create the necessary tables, define primary and foreign keys, and set any other constraints.
Data Population:

Insert sample data into the tables to simulate a small inventory and customer database.
Query Implementation:

Write SQL queries to perform the following operations:
Retrieve a list of all books by a specific author.
Retrieve the details of a book with a given ISBN.
Retrieve the customer information who placed an order.
Calculate the total sales revenue for a given month.
List the books with the highest average customer ratings.
Presentation:

Prepare a brief presentation summarizing your database design, key attributes, relationships, and the SQL queries you wrote.
Deliverables:

Entity, attribute, key, and relationship analysis document.
SQL script file with database schema creation, data population, and query implementations.
