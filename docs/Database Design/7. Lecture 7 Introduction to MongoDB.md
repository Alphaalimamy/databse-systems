**Lecture 1: What is MongoDB? History and Purpose**

**Introduction to MongoDB:**

- MongoDB is a popular NoSQL database that falls under the category of document-oriented databases.
- Unlike traditional relational databases, MongoDB stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents.

**History of MongoDB:**

- MongoDB was developed by 10gen (now known as MongoDB, Inc.) and was released in 2009.
- It was designed to address limitations of traditional relational databases in handling large-scale, unstructured or semi-structured data.
- MongoDB gained rapid adoption due to its flexibility, scalability, and ability to handle diverse data types.

**Purpose of MongoDB:**

- MongoDB is designed to handle large volumes of data with varying structures, such as sensor data, social media posts, and product catalogs.
- It excels in scenarios where data evolves over time and requires frequent updates to its schema.
- MongoDB is well-suited for modern applications that require flexibility, scalability, and quick development cycles.

### Key Features and Benefits of MongoDB

**Key Features:**

- Document-Based Storage: Data is stored in JSON-like documents (BSON format) that can have varying structures.

```json
{
  "name": "Alpha",
  "age": 12,
  "course": "Software Engineering"
}
```

- Scalability: MongoDB supports horizontal scaling through sharding, allowing it to handle large datasets and high traffic.
- Flexible Schema: No rigid schema requirements; documents in the same collection can have different fields.
- Indexing: Supports various types of indexes (single field, compound, geospatial, text) for efficient querying.
- Aggregation Framework: Provides a powerful way to perform complex data transformations and analysis.
- Automatic Sharding: Built-in sharding support for distributing data across multiple servers and clusters.
- High Availability: Supports replica sets for automatic failover and data redundancy.

**Benefits:**

- Rapid development and iteration due to flexible schema.
- Better performance for certain use cases due to document-oriented storage.
- Improved scalability and distribution for large-scale applications.
- Efficient handling of unstructured or semi-structured data.
- Reduced need for complex joins, leading to faster queries.

### Comparison with Traditional Relational Databases

**Differences from Relational Databases:**

- Schema: MongoDB uses a flexible, schema-less approach compared to rigid schemas in relational databases.
- Data Model: MongoDB stores data in documents, whereas relational databases use tables with rows and columns.
- Normalization: Relational databases emphasize normalization, while MongoDB emphasizes embedding related data in documents.
- Transactions: Relational databases provide ACID transactions, whereas MongoDB offers multi-document transactions in recent versions.
- Joins: Relational databases rely on joins for data retrieval, while MongoDB encourages denormalization and nested documents.

**Scenarios where MongoDB Excels:**

- Rapidly evolving applications with changing data requirements.
- Applications dealing with large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data.
- Projects requiring high scalability and horizontal distribution.
- Use cases where quick development cycles are crucial.

**Document-Oriented Data Model:**

- Stores data in flexible, self-contained documents.
- Each document can have a different structure.
- Emphasizes nesting and hierarchy.

**Advantages of Document Model:**

- Schema Flexibility: No fixed schema; fields can vary.
- Simplified Joins: Relationships can be embedded.
- Performance: Efficient retrieval of complete documents.
- Scalability: Scales horizontally using sharding.

**MongoDB Document Structure:**

- Documents resemble JSON (key-value pairs).
- Values can be strings, numbers, arrays, or nested documents.

**Collections:**

- A collection is a group of related documents.
- Similar to tables in relational databases, but without a fixed schema.

**BSON Format:**

- BSON (Binary JSON) is MongoDB's binary-encoded serialization format.
- Provides additional data types and is optimized for storage and retrieval.

### Installing and Setting Up MongoDB

**Downloading and Installing MongoDB:**

**Step 1: Download MongoDB**

- Visit the MongoDB download page: [download mongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community)
- Choose the appropriate version for your operating system. For Windows, you'll likely want the "MSI" package.

**Step 2: Install MongoDB**

- Locate the downloaded .msi file and double-click on it to start the installation process.
- The MongoDB Setup Wizard will appear. Click "Next" to proceed.

**Step 3: Choose Installation Directory**

- Choose the setup type:
  - "Complete" installs the MongoDB server, MongoDB Tools, and MongoDB Compass.
  - "Custom" allows you to select specific components to install.
  - "Typical" installs MongoDB server and tools.
- Select your preferred setup type and click "Next."

**Step 5: Service Configuration**

- Choose how you want MongoDB to be run as a service:

  - "Run service as Network Service user" is usually the default and recommended option
  - You can also choose to have MongoDB run under a different user account.

- Click "Next" when you've made your selection.

**Step 6: MongoDB Compass (Optional)**

- MongoDB Compass is a graphical user interface for MongoDB. You can choose to install it by checking the box.

**Step 7: Install MongoDB**

- Review your installation choices and click "Install" to begin the installation process.

**Step 8: Installation Progress**

- Click "Finish" to exit the setup wizard.

**Step 10: Verify Installation**

- Open the Command Prompt or PowerShell.

- Navigate to the MongoDB installation directory. The default installation directory is `C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\<version>\bin.`
- Run the following command to start the MongoDB server:

**Basic Server Administration Commands:**

- **mongod** --dbpath `<path>`: Start the MongoDB server and specify the data storage directory.
- **mongo**: Start the MongoDB shell to interact with the database.
- **show dbs**: List all available databases.
- use `<db-name>`: Switch to a specific database.
- **show collections**: List all collections in the current database.
- **db.collectionName.find()**: Retrieve documents from a collection.
- **db.collectionName.insertOne({})**: Insert a document into a collection.

**Creating Documents in MongoDB:**

- Documents are created using the `insertOne() or insertMany()` methods.
- Example:

```json
db.customers.insertOne({
  name: "Alpha Alimamy",
  age: 28,
  email: "alpha@test.com"
})
```

**Retrieving Documents:**

- Documents are retrieved using the `find()` method.
- Example:

```json
db.customers.find({ name: "Alpha Alimamy" })
```

**Updating Documents:**

- Documents can be updated using `updateOne() or updateMany()` methods.
- Example:

```json
db.customers.updateOne(
  { name: "Alpha Alimamy" },
  { $set: { age: 29 } }
)
```

**Deleting Documents:**

- Documents are deleted using `deleteOne() or deleteMany()` methods.
- Example:

```json
db.customers.deleteOne({ name: "Alpha Alimamy" })
```

**Design Considerations for Document Model:**

- **Data Duplication:** Some duplication might be necessary for performance.
- **Embedding vs. Referencing:** Decide between embedding related data or referencing it.
- **Atomic Operations:** MongoDB supports atomic operations for data integrity.

**Use Cases for the Document Model:**

- Content Management: Blog posts, comments, user profiles.
- E-commerce: Products, orders, customer reviews.
- Real-Time Analytics: Event logs, user activity, metrics.

db.createCollection("orders")
```

- 4.Insert Documents: Insert sample documents into each collection.

```json
db.products.insertOne({
  name: "Mobile Phone",
  price: 500,
  stock: 100
})

db.customers.insertOne({
  name: "Alpha Omar Leigh",
  email: "leigh@gmail.com"
})

db.orders.insertOne({
  customer: "Alpha Omar Leigh",
  products: ["leigh@gmail.com"],
  total: 500
