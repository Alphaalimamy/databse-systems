### Introduction to MongoDB Transactions

- Transactions in MongoDB ensure data consistency and integrity across multiple operations.
- A transaction groups several operations into a single unit, ensuring all succeed or all fail.

**Sample Business Problem:**
- Imagine you're managing an inventory system. 
- You want to ensure that when a customer places an order, the stock is reduced and the order is recorded as a single transaction.

**Creating Database and Inserting Records:**
- 1.Create a new database:

`use inventory_system`

- 2.Insert sample product data:
```json
db.products.insertMany([
  { name: "Product A", stock: 100 },
  { name: "Product B", stock: 50 },
  { name: "Product C", stock: 200 },
  { name: "Product D", stock: 75 }
  // ... more products ...
])
```

**Implementing Transaction:**

- 1.Start a session:
```json
session = db.getMongo().startSession()
session.startTransaction()
```

- 2.Perform operations within the transaction:
- Decrease product stock by 1 for "Product A".
- Insert a record in the "orders" collection.

```json
try {
  db.products.updateOne(
    { name: "Product A" },
    { $inc: { stock: -1 } },
    { session: session }
  )

  db.orders.insertOne(
    { product: "Product A", quantity: 1 },
    { session: session }
  )

  session.commitTransaction()
} catch (error) {
  session.abortTransaction()
} finally {
  session.endSession()
}
```

**Benefits of Transactions:**
- Data Integrity: Transactions ensure that data remains consistent during complex operations.
- Atomicity: All or none of the operations within a transaction are completed.
- Isolation: Transactions operate independently, providing a view of the data before and after the transaction.

**Use Cases for Transactions:**
- Order processing systems to manage stock and order creation.
- Financial systems requiring precise operations and data consistency.
- Any scenario where multiple actions need to be performed atomically.

**Summary**

In this lecture, we explored MongoDB Transactions using a sample business problem in the context of an inventory system. We discussed the importance of transactions, how to start, perform, commit, and abort transactions. We created a database, inserted sample product records, and executed a transaction that reduces the stock of a product and records the order. Transactions ensure data integrity and consistency, making them crucial for scenarios where complex operations must be performed as a single unit of work in MongoDB.
