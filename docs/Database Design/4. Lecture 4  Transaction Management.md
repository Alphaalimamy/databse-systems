### Introduction to Transactions and ACID Properties:

- **Transactions**: A transaction is a series of database operations treated as a single unit of work. 
- For example, transferring money from one bank account to another involves deducting the amount from one account and adding it to another.

**ACID Properties:**
- **Atomicity**: Transactions are atomic, meaning they are either fully completed or fully rolled back if an error occurs. Example: Consider transferring money: either both the debit and credit occur, or none at all.

- **Consistency**: Transactions bring the database from one consistent state to another, maintaining data integrity. After a successful transfer, the total amount in both accounts should remain constant.
- **Isolation**: Transactions are isolated from each other to prevent interference and ensure each transaction sees only committed changes. If multiple transfers are happening concurrently, each should be isolated to prevent interference.
- **Durability**: Once a transaction is committed, its changes are permanent and survive system failures.

**Transaction Control Statements (BEGIN, COMMIT, ROLLBACK):**

- **BEGIN or START TRANSACTION**: Start a new transaction.
- **COMMIT**: Confirm and make permanent the changes within a transaction.
- **ROLLBACK**: Cancel the changes made within a transaction.

**Example:**
Consider transferring money between two bank accounts. If the debit succeeds but the credit fails, we should roll back the debit operation to maintain consistency.

**Isolation Levels and Their Implications:**

- Different isolation levels affect how transactions see each other's changes:
    - **READ UNCOMMITTED**: A transaction can read uncommitted changes from other transactions.
    - **READ COMMITTED**: A transaction can only read committed changes, avoiding dirty reads.
    - **REPEATABLE READ:** A transaction's reads are consistent throughout its lifetime, even if other transactions commit changes.
    - **SERIALIZABLE**: Transactions are fully isolated from each other, ensuring no concurrency issues.

**Example:**
- Consider two customers transferring money simultaneously. 
- At the **READ UNCOMMITTED** level, one transaction might see the partial effects of the other.

**Handling Transaction Failures and Recovery:**
- Transaction Failure: A transaction can fail due to various reasons, including errors, deadlocks, or system crashes.
- Rollback and Recovery: When a transaction fails, it should be rolled back to maintain the integrity of the data. Database systems provide mechanisms to recover data to a consistent state after system crashes.


Example:
Suppose you are building an e-commerce platform. When a customer places an order, the following steps occur within a transaction:

- Deduct the ordered quantity from the available stock.
- Add an order record to the Orders table.
- Charge the customer's payment method.


**Important**
- If any of these steps fail, the entire transaction should be rolled back to maintain data consistency.
- Consider the importance of maintaining the ACID properties in financial systems, where data integrity is paramount.
- Understanding transaction management is crucial for developing robust and reliable database applications, especially in scenarios where data consistency and integrity are critical.

**DEMO**

**Step 1: Create the Database and Tables**
    
```sql
-- Create the database
CREATE DATABASE CustomerDB;

-- Use the database
USE CustomerDB;

-- Create the Customers table
CREATE TABLE Customers (
    CustomerID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    Name VARCHAR(100),
    Balance DECIMAL(10, 2)
);

-- Create the Orders table
CREATE TABLE Orders (
    OrderID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    CustomerID INT,
    TotalAmount DECIMAL(10, 2),
    FOREIGN KEY (CustomerID) REFERENCES Customers(CustomerID)
);
```

### Step 2: Implement Transactions with Examples

**Example 1: Successful Purchase Transaction**
```sql
-- Begin the transaction
START TRANSACTION;

-- Deduct the order amount from the customer's balance
UPDATE Customers SET Balance = Balance - 150 WHERE CustomerID = 123;

-- Insert a new order record
INSERT INTO Orders (OrderID, CustomerID, TotalAmount) VALUES (1, 123, 150);

-- Commit the transaction
COMMIT;
```

**Example 2: Failed Reservation Transaction**
```sql
-- Begin the transaction
START TRANSACTION;

-- Attempt to update inventory
UPDATE Inventory SET Quantity = Quantity - 1 WHERE ProductID = 'P001';

-- Something goes wrong, need to rollback
ROLLBACK;
```


**Example 3: Handling Isolation Levels**
```sql
-- Set isolation level to READ COMMITTED
SET SESSION TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL READ COMMITTED;

-- User 1: Update product price
BEGIN;
UPDATE Products SET Price = 200 WHERE ProductID = 'P001';
COMMIT;

-- User 2: View product details
BEGIN;
SELECT * FROM Products WHERE ProductID = 'P001';
COMMIT;
```
**Example 4: Handling Transaction Failures and Recovery**

```sql
-- Begin the transaction
START TRANSACTION;

-- Process an order (update inventory, create order record)
UPDATE Inventory SET Quantity = Quantity - 1 WHERE ProductID = 'P002';
INSERT INTO Orders (OrderID, CustomerID, TotalAmount) VALUES (2, 124, 80);

-- System crash! Need to recover or rollback
ROLLBACK;
```
**Example 5: Applying SERIALIZABLE Isolation Level**
```sql
-- Set isolation level to SERIALIZABLE
SET SESSION TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL SERIALIZABLE;

-- User 1: Attempt to book a seat
BEGIN;
INSERT INTO Reservations (SeatNumber, CustomerID) VALUES ('A101', 125);
-- User 2: Attempt to book the same seat (conflict!)
-- System ensures only one reservation succeeds
ROLLBACK;
```
**SUMMARY**

In this example, we've created a customer database, implemented transactions with different examples, demonstrated isolation levels and their implications, and showed how to handle transaction failures and recovery. This process ensures data integrity and reliability in database operations.
