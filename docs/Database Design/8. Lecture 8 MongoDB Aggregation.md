### Introduction to MongoDB Aggregation:
- The MongoDB Aggregation Framework is a versatile tool for data manipulation, transformation, and analysis.
- It allows you to perform complex operations directly within the database.

**Sample Business Problem:**

Let's consider you're managing an e-commerce platform. You want to analyze your sales data to find the average price of products sold per category.


**Aggregation Stages for Business Problem:**

**Creating Database and Inserting Records:**
- 1.Create a new database:

`use ecommerce`
- 2.Insert sample data:

```json
db.orders.insertMany([
  {
    status: "completed",
    items: [
      { name: "Product A", category: "Electronics", price: 499.99 },
      { name: "Product B", category: "Clothing", price: 39.99 }
    ]
  },
  {
    status: "completed",
    items: [
      { name: "Product C", category: "Electronics", price: 299.99 },
      { name: "Product D", category: "Accessories", price: 19.99 }
    ]
  }
  // ... more orders ...
])
```

**Executing Aggregation:**

```json
db.orders.aggregate([
   { $match: { status: "completed" } },
   { $unwind: "$items" },
   {
     $group: {
       _id: "$items.category",
       avgPrice: { $avg: "$items.price" }
     }
   },
   { $sort: { avgPrice: 1 } }
])
```
**Results**:
- The aggregation query will return the average price of products sold per category, sorted in ascending order of average price.

**Match Stage:**
- Filters documents based on specific criteria.
- For this problem, we'll consider only completed orders.

```json
{ $match: { status: "completed" } }
```

**Unwind Stage:**
- Deconstructs an array field into multiple documents.
- Each item in an order becomes a separate document.

```json
{ $unwind: "$items" }
```

**Group Stage:**

- Groups documents based on specified fields and calculates aggregates.
- We'll group by product category and calculate the average price for each category.

```json
{
  $group: {
    _id: "$items.category",
    avgPrice: { $avg: "$items.price" }
  }
}
```
**Sort Stage:**
- Sorts the grouped data in ascending order of average price.

```json
{ $sort: { avgPrice: 1 } }
```

**Benefits of Aggregation Framework:**
- Enables sophisticated data analysis directly within the database.
- Provides insights into data patterns and trends.
- Reduces the need for complex application-side processing.

**Use Cases for Aggregation Framework:**
- Sales analysis, financial reporting, and user behavior tracking.
- Complex data transformations and data summarization.

**Summary**

- In this lecture, we explored the MongoDB Aggregation Framework using a sample business problem in the context of an e-commerce platform. We discussed each aggregation stage, including match, unwind, group, and sort. 
- We created a database, inserted sample records, and executed an aggregation query to find the average price of products sold per category. 
- This framework is a powerful tool for performing advanced data analysis and manipulation directly within MongoDB.
