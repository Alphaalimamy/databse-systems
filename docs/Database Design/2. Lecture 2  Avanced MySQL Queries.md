### Introduction to MySQL Conditions

- SQL conditions are used to filter and manipulate data retrieved from a database based on specific criteria.
- Conditions are employed in queries to determine which rows to include in the result set and which to exclude.
- These conditions are specified using various clauses and operators, allowing you to express complex filtering and logic requirements.

**Assuming we have the following tables from the library management database:**

- `Book with columns:` ISBN, Title, Author, Genre, PublicationYear, CopiesAvailable
- `Member with columns:` ID, Name, ContactInformation, MembershipStatus
- `Borrowing with columns:` BorrowingID, BorrowerID, ISBN, BorrowingDate, DueDate, ReturnDate

**WHERE Clause for Filtering Rows**

- The WHERE clause is used to filter rows from a table based on specified conditions.
- It follows the SELECT statement in SQL queries.
- For instance, you can use the WHERE clause to retrieve all books published after a certain year or all members with a particular membership status.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM Book
WHERE PublicationYear > 2020;
```

**class Exercise**

- Select all the books that were published before 2019

```sql
SELECT  Title, Author
FROM Book
WHERE PublicationYear > 2020;
```

**class Exercise**

- Select  the Title ,  PublicationYear and AvailableCopies of the books that were published after 2019

**Comparison Operators `(=, <, >, BETWEEN, etc.)`**

- Comparison operators are utilized to compare values in SQL queries.
- These operators include **`=, <, >, <=, >=, <> (not equal), and BETWEEN`**
- They allow you to create conditions for filtering data based on the relationship between column values and specified constants.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM Member
WHERE MembershipYear BETWEEN 2010 AND 2020;
```

**Class Exercise**
- Select all the members that joined from 2016 to 2019
- 

**Logical Operators (AND, OR, NOT):**

- Logical operators **(AND, OR, NOT)** enable you to combine multiple conditions to create complex filtering criteria.
- These operators are used to specify how conditions should be evaluated in relation to each other.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM Book
WHERE Genre = 'Fiction' AND CopiesAvailable > 5;
```

**IN and NOT IN Operators**

- The IN and NOT IN operators allow you to specify a list of values for comparison, simplifying the process of filtering rows with specific column values.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM Book
WHERE Genre IN ('Technology', 'Fiction');
```

**NULL and IS NULL Operators**
The NULL value represents the absence of data. The IS NULL and IS NOT NULL operators are used to filter rows based on whether a column contains a NULL value or not.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM Book
WHERE PublicationYear IS NULL;
```

**CASE Statement for Conditional Logic:**

- The CASE statement provides a way to apply conditional logic within SQL queries.
- It allows you to evaluate a set of conditions and return a specific value or expression based on the matching condition.

```sql
SELECT Title,
       CASE
           WHEN PublicationYear < 2000 THEN 'Old'
           WHEN PublicationYear >= 2000 AND PublicationYear <= 2010 THEN 'Moderate'
           ELSE 'Recent'
       END AS PublicationStatus
FROM Book;
```

**Combining Conditions:**

- Conditions can be combined using logical operators to create more intricate filtering criteria.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM Member
WHERE (MembershipStatus = 'Active' OR MembershipStatus = 'Pending')
  AND RegistrationYear >= 2018;
```

**Order of Evaluation in Conditions:**

- Conditions in SQL are evaluated based on their precedence and order within parentheses.
- Logical operators **(AND, OR)** have their own order of evaluation, which can be modified by using parentheses to group conditions.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM Book
WHERE Genre = 'Fiction' AND (CopiesAvailable > 5 OR PublicationYear > 2010);
```

### Exercises

**Exercise 1: WHERE Clause and Comparison Operators**

- Retrieve the names of all members who joined the library before the year 2015.

**Exercise 2: Logical Operators and NULL**

- Retrieve the titles of books that are either in the "Mystery" genre or have no specified author.
  **Exercise 3: IN Operator and Combining Conditions**
- Retrieve the names of members who have borrowed books with ISBNs '978-0451452457' or '978-0345339683' and returned them after the due date.

**Exercise 4: CASE Statement and Range Conditions**

- Create a report that displays the names of books along with their status: 'Available' if copies are available, 'On Hold' if all copies are currently borrowed, and 'Out of Stock' if there are no copies available.

**Exercise 5: Combining Conditions with Logical Operators**

- Retrieve the names of members who joined in the year 2020 and have either an 'Active' or 'Pending' membership status.

### Introduction to Aggregate Functions

- Aggregate functions in MySQL perform calculations on a set of values and return a single value as the result.
- They are used to summarize and analyze data in various ways, such as finding the total, average, maximum, minimum, or count of values.
- **Common Aggregate Functions (SUM, AVG, COUNT, MAX, MIN):**
  - `SUM(column):` Calculates the sum of values in a numeric column.
  - `AVG(column):` Calculates the average of values in a numeric column.
  - `COUNT(column):` Counts the number of non-null values in a column.
  - `MAX(column):` Returns the maximum value in a column.
  - `MIN(column):` Returns the minimum value in a column.

**Using GROUP BY Clause:**

- The GROUP BY clause is used with aggregate functions to group rows that share the same values in one or more columns.
- This allows you to perform aggregate calculations on each group separately.

```sql
SELECT Genre, COUNT(*) AS BookCount
FROM Book
GROUP BY Genre;
```

**HAVING Clause for Filtering Grouped Data:**

- The HAVING clause is used to filter the results of a GROUP BY query based on aggregate function results.

```sql
SELECT Genre, AVG(CopiesAvailable) AS AvgCopies
FROM Book
GROUP BY Genre
HAVING AVG(CopiesAvailable) > 5;
```

**Examples of Aggregating Data:**

- Example: Calculate the total number of books borrowed by each member.

```sql
SELECT BorrowerID, COUNT(*) AS BorrowedBooks
FROM Borrowing
GROUP BY BorrowerID;
```

**Combining Aggregate Functions and Joins:**

- Example: Retrieve the average copies available for each genre and display the corresponding genre name.

```sql
SELECT Genre, AVG(CopiesAvailable) AS AvgCopies
FROM Book
GROUP BY Genre;
```

**NULL Handling in Aggregate Functions:**

- By default, aggregate functions exclude NULL values from calculations.
- However, you can use the IFNULL or COALESCE function to handle NULL values before applying an aggregate function.

- Example: Calculate the average publication year, handling NULL values using IFNULL.

```sql
SELECT AVG(IFNULL(PublicationYear, 0)) AS AvgPublicationYear
FROM Book;
```

**Note:**
Aggregate functions are powerful tools for analyzing data trends, calculating summaries, and extracting valuable insights from large datasets. Practice using these functions in various scenarios to strengthen your SQL skills.

### MySQL JOINS

**Introduction to Joins:**

- Joins are a fundamental concept in SQL that allow you to combine data from multiple tables based on a related column. They enable you to retrieve information that is spread across different tables in a single query.

**Types of Joins (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, FULL):**

- `INNER JOIN:` Retrieves records where there is a match in both tables being joined.
- `LEFT JOIN (or LEFT OUTER JOIN):` Retrieves all records from the left table and matching records from the right table.
- `RIGHT JOIN (or RIGHT OUTER JOIN):` Retrieves all records from the right table and matching records from the left table.
- `FULL JOIN (or FULL OUTER JOIN):` Retrieves all records from both tables, including unmatched records.

**Using the JOIN Clause:**

- The JOIN clause is used to combine tables based on a specified column relationship.
- It's commonly used with ON or USING clauses to define the joining condition.

```sql
SELECT Book.Title, Member.Name
FROM Book
INNER JOIN Borrowing ON Book.ISBN = Borrowing.ISBN
INNER JOIN Member ON Borrowing.BorrowerID = Member.ID;
```

**JOINing Multiple Tables:**

- You can join multiple tables in a single query to retrieve data from interconnected tables.

```sql
SELECT Book.Title, Member.Name, Borrowing.BorrowingDate
FROM Book
INNER JOIN Borrowing ON Book.ISBN = Borrowing.ISBN
INNER JOIN Member ON Borrowing.BorrowerID = Member.ID;
```

**Aliasing Tables:**

- Aliasing involves assigning short names (aliases) to tables, making queries more concise and easier to read.
- Example: Aliasing tables to shorten column references.

```sql
SELECT b.Title, m.Name
FROM Book AS b
INNER JOIN Member AS m ON b.BorrowerID = m.ID;
```

**Combining Joins and Subqueries:**

- You can use subqueries within join conditions to further filter data or retrieve values from subqueries.
- Example: Retrieve members who have borrowed books published after 2010.

```sql
SELECT m.Name
FROM Member AS m
INNER JOIN Borrowing AS b ON m.ID = b.BorrowerID
INNER JOIN Book AS bk ON b.ISBN = bk.ISBN
WHERE bk.PublicationYear > 2010;
```

**Self-Joins:**

- A self-join involves joining a table with itself. This can be useful when you need to establish relationships within the same table.
- Example: Retrieve pairs of members who borrowed the same book.

```sql
SELECT m1.Name AS Member1, m2.Name AS Member2, b.Title
FROM Borrowing AS b1
INNER JOIN Borrowing AS b2 ON b1.ISBN = b2.ISBN AND b1.BorrowerID < b2.BorrowerID
INNER JOIN Member AS m1 ON b1.BorrowerID = m1.ID
INNER JOIN Member AS m2 ON b2.BorrowerID = m2.ID
INNER JOIN Book AS b ON b1.ISBN = b.ISBN;
```

**Using OUTER JOINs:**

- Outer joins include non-matching rows from one or both tables.
- They are useful when you want to retrieve records that may not have corresponding matches in the joined table.

**Performance Considerations:**

- Joins can impact query performance. Proper indexing and understanding the query execution plan are crucial.
- Inner joins are typically faster than outer joins.
- Too many joins can lead to complex queries and slower performance.

### MySQL Indexes

**Introduction to Indexes**

- Indexes are database structures that improve the speed of data retrieval operations, such as SELECT queries.
- They serve as pointers to the actual data in tables and help the database management system locate specific rows efficiently.

**Types of Indexes (B-tree, Hash, Full-Text, etc.)**

- `B-tree Indexes`: Commonly used indexes that organize data in a balanced tree structure.
- `Hash Indexes`: Use hash functions to map values to index entries.
- `Full-Text Indexes`: Enable efficient text-based searches within large datasets.
- `Spatial Indexes`: Optimize spatial data for geographical or location-based searches.

**Creating Indexes:**

- Indexes can be created on one or more columns to accelerate data retrieval.
- Example: Creating an index on the Author column of the Book table.

```sql
CREATE INDEX author_index ON Book (Author);
```

**Indexing Guidelines and Best Practices:**

- Index columns frequently used in WHERE, JOIN, and ORDER BY clauses.
- Avoid over-indexing, as it can slow down data modification operations.
- Consider the balance between read and write operations.
- Regularly analyze query patterns to determine which columns need indexes.

**Composite Indexes:**

- Composite (multi-column) indexes involve indexing multiple columns together.
- They are beneficial when querying involves multiple columns.
- Example: Creating a composite index on Genre and PublicationYear.

```sql
CREATE INDEX genre_pub_year_index ON Book (Genre, PublicationYear);
```

**Dropping Indexes:**

- Indexes can be dropped when they are no longer needed.
- Example: Dropping the author_index index.

```sql
DROP INDEX author_index ON Book;
```

**Impact on Query Performance:**

- Indexes can significantly improve query performance by reducing the number of rows the database needs to scan.

**Analyzing Index Usage:**

- Database systems provide tools to analyze index usage and identify slow queries that could benefit from indexing.
